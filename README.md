# Underwater Acoustic Environment Explorer

## Abstract

This app collects, displays, and handles downloads of environmental data relevant to underwater propagation modeling, and is intended to be a flexible front end to any propagation modeling framework.  Data includes bathymetry, sound speed profiles, and seabed composition. Data calls are supported by the NOAA ERDDAP servers and the USGS usSEABED database.
